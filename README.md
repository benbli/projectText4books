# Project Three test4books

test4books

Test4Books is a web application which allows students (users) on a university campus to sell a texbook to another student who attends the same university as the seller. Test4Books is awesome because it's community minded, eliminates big business and keeps the wallet of students fat. Well, as fat as a student's wallet typically is.
