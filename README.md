> Buy or sell textbooks to and from your peers.

This application was created with thrifty college students in mind. Textbook prices are getting out of hand, so buy them from students at a reasonable price instead!

Test4Books is a web application which allows students (users) on a university campus to sell a texbook to another student who attends the same university as the seller. Test4Books is awesome because it's community minded, eliminates big business and keeps the wallet of students fat. Well, as fat as a student's wallet typically is.
